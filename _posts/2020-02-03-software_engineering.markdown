 Just last year in the month of june, I finally graduated high school after years of just flying by. As graduation passed by along with friends going off to college, while I was left on what I should do with my life. I began to work at many places to branch out and see what I'm more interested in, but nothing was clicking. After many gaming sessions with my brother on the PS4, he started talking about a school where he can learn about software engineering. After hearing about the career in small details, I began to develop an interest for the workfield, and started to look more into it. I suddenly found myself wanting to learn all that I could in this high-demand job. My eyes we're not only fond of the pay that can be earned, but that it can be turned in to an indie development after I learn enough to be on my own. So why did I choose software engineering? Long story short it's a light that has lit up a room inside of me where I was once lost with no idea what to do.
